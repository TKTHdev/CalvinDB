----------------------This is the Geo-replicated CalvinDB codebase (are currently working on)---------------------------

Installation(This is for Ubuntu 14.04, it should be similar with other Linux distribution):
1. You should install the following softwares:
   Git
   make,g++
   autoconf, libtool,libreadline-dev,libsnappy-dev
   subversion
   unzip, tar
   cmake


2. You should install the following external libraries:
    --- protobuf
    --- glog
    --- zeromq
    --- gflags

   I wrote a script(install-ext), so that you can directly run this script to download and compile the libraries.


3. After that, you should add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the ~/.bashrc, below is my cofig:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/CalvinDB/ext/zeromq/src/.libs:~/CalvinDB/ext/protobuf/src/.libs:~/CalvinDB/ext/glog/.libs:~/CalvinDB/ext/gflags/.libs


Then run source ~/.bashrc.
